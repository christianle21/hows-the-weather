# Weather Dashboard

This assignment that I did is designed as a weather forecasting dashboard where you can search for a city's weather and you can see the current day's forecast along with the next five days for whatever city you choose.

To use this, simply type in the city you want to see the weather for in the search bar and hit enter or click the search button. The search can include more specific data such as an address or zip code.

After entering your searched city, every city you type in will be displayed in the search results in a list below the search bar. You can click on any of the cities names to see the weather for them again.
